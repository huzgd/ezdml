Base JIT design concept:

  1. It is mostly a damn simple method-based native-code-template-concatenation JIT mostly without any
     fancy optimizations just as CSE, SSA, and so on.

  2. The native code execution can be continued from any correspondent byte code instruction, so it
     is possible to jump to any byte-code-instruction-mapped native-code-sub-block from any each
     other in the same code context and in the same code instande.

  3. The from the JIT generated native code can call the correspondent byte code instruction dispatcher
     function from the byte code interpreter at every time, if it needed, for example, for complex byte
     code instructions which are more trouble than it's worth to compile these to native code.

  4. The virtual byte code interpreter VM registers are used instead the native platform target CPU
     registers, for to keep the fallback-to-byte-code-instruction-dispatcher-function-stuff simple just
     much as possible.

  5. The from the JIT generated native code can be self-modifying, for example at the monomorphic and
     polymorphic inline caching based byte code instructions, by modifying some index constant values
     at some native code instruction opcode arguments. But this is optional, since the byte code itself
     is also self-modifying in this monomorphic and polymorphic inline caching context. It's mostly a
     trade-off, which way performs better on which target platform CPU architecture.

  6. A byte-code-instruction-offset <-> native-code-instruction-offset map must be generated and used
     for the jump-in-to-random-code-position-usage and for the effective use of the fallback-to-byte-
     code-instruction-dispatcher-function-stuff.
